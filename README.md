# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sumana!

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a deep passion for **data science** and **statistics**. Over the years, I've built a strong foundation in **programming**, **mathematical modeling**, and **statistical analysis**â€”essential tools for making sense of complex datasets and uncovering meaningful insights.

What drives me is a genuine curiosity about the world and a desire to solve real-world problems through **data-driven approaches**. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges, whether it's through personal projects, open-source contributions, or collaborative work with like-minded individuals.

 **ðŸ”­ Currently Exploring**
- Machine learning & deep learning  
- Time series forecasting  
- Real-world applications of statistical models 

ðŸ“« **Let's connect!**  
Feel free to explore my repositories, open an issue, or drop me a message [here](mailto:1910sumanasarkar@gmail.com). I'm always open to collaboration and learning from others!
